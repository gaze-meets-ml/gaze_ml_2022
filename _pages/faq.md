## Common FAQs: 

**Questions related to presentation**

- Should I upload two separate versions if I have a poster and an oral presentation? 
    - No. This is a backup so just an oral presentation is sufficient. However, authors still need to prepare a poster presentation to display in person. 

- Do I still have to upload a pre-recording if I only have a poster? 
    - Yes, authors need to upload presentations regardless of their presence (i.e. physical or virtual). Format: 10 min max presentation)

- How long should the video (and subsequently the oral presentation) be that authors need to upload via the SlidesLive platform? 
    - 10 mins max.

- Poster Dimension instructions: 
    - Poster sizes: 24"w x 36"h (61 cm w x 91.5 cm h)
    - Optional (you do not need to use this service only if you want to): NeurIPS has also arranged for T3Expo to support pre-printing and delivery of posters for you.
