We are excited to host the first-ever <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Gaze Meets ML</span> workshop on <b>December 3rd, 2022</b> in conjunction with NeurIPS 2022. We’ve got a great lineup of [speakers](https://gaze-meets-ml.github.io/gaze_ml_2022/speakers/). <b>If you are interested in sponsoring, please find more information <a href="https://gaze-meets-ml.github.io/gaze_ml_2022/call_for_sponsors/">here</a></b>.

# About             <img src="https://gaze-meets-ml.github.io/gaze_ml_2022/images/eye-gaze-large.png" width="75"/> 
Eye gaze has proven to be a cost-efficient way to collect large-scale physiological data that can reveal the underlying
human attentional patterns in real life workflows, and thus has long been explored as a signal to directly measure
human-related cognition in various domains. Physiological data (including but not limited to eye gaze) offer new
perception capabilities, which could be used in several ML domains, e.g., egocentric perception, embodiedAI, NLP, etc.
They can help infer human perception, intentions, beliefs, goals and other cognition properties that are much needed for
human-AI interactions and agent coordination. In addition, large collections of eye-tracking data have enabled
data-driven modeling of human visual attention mechanisms, both for saliency or scanpath prediction, with twofold
advantages: from the neuroscientific perspective to understand biological mechanisms better, from the AI perspective to
equip agents with the ability to mimic or predict human behavior and improve interpretability and interactions.

With the emergence of immersive technologies, now more than any time there is a need for experts of various backgrounds
(e.g., machine learning, vision, and neuroscience communities) to share expertise and contribute to a deeper
understanding of the intricacies of cost-efficient human supervision signals (e.g., eye-gaze) and their utilization
towards by bridging human cognition and AI in machine learning research and development. The goal of this workshop is to
bring together an active research community to collectively drive progress in defining and addressing core problems in
gaze-assisted machine learning.

# Call for Papers
We welcome submissions that present aspects of eye-gaze in regards to cognitive science, psychophysiology and computer
science, or propose methods on integrating eye gaze into machine learning. We are also looking for applications from radiology, AR/VR,
autonomous driving, etc. that introduce methods and models utilizing eye gaze technology in their respective domains.
Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:
<ul>
    <li>Understanding the neuroscience of eye-gaze and perception.</li>
    <li>State of the art in incorporating machine learning and eye-tracking.</li>
    <li>Annotation and ML supervision with eye-gaze.</li>
